_Where discomfort becomes the start of innovation._

## 📌 What is Uncomfortable Hub?

**Uncomfortable Hub** is a community platform designed to gather and transform minor, everyday discomforts into innovative ideas.

Our goal is to move beyond simply complaining. We want to **openly share real-world problems** and then **build actual services to solve the most upvoted ones.**

## 💡 Our Motivation

Most successful services and products solve a problem.  
Yet, people often don't realize how valuable their daily annoyances can be as a source of ideas.

Uncomfortable Hub brings these discomforts together, using the power of **collective intelligence** to pinpoint the core of a problem. This allows us to focus on the most pressing issues and build practical solutions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Share Your Discomfort**  
   Anyone can anonymously post about a discomfort they're experiencing.

2. **Upvote and Suggest**  
   Users can upvote shared discomforts and propose solutions in the comments.

3. **Project Selection**  
   The discomforts with the most upvotes and suggested solutions are selected to become an official _project_.

4. **Open Development**  
   As the sole developer, I will build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the selected project.  
   The entire process will be transparent to the community, and feedback will be welcomed every step of the way.
